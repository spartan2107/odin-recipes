    <h2>Description</h2>
    Goulash is a slightly spicy stew containing meat and vegetables seasoned with paprika and other spices. Goulash orginates from Hungary and is a common dish eaten in many parts of central Europe. Goulash is most commonly made as a stew but can be made as a soup. It often uses beef, veal, lamb, or pork, as the meats and potatos as the vegetable. The preferred cuts of meat for goulash are the shank, shin, or shoulder. Note: Historically Hungarian accurate Goulash would not have contained potatoes, as they did not arrive in Europe until the 15th century. Tomato is also a later addition.
