    <h2>Description</h2>
    Pretzels are a baked pastry made from dough that is traditionally shaped into a knot. They originate from South German and are featured in Swiss, Austrian, and German cusines. They can be seasoned with salt, cinnamon, cheese, or sugar. They can be made into "hard-baked" pretzels which have a long shelf-life. This version is a "soft" pretzel, intended to be eaten shortly after preparation.
